## Parliament Starter Project

We like to compare documentation types to aisles in a grocery store.
Each aisle includes related templates, which you can think of as ingredients.
Use these ingredients in documentation cookbooks to whip up docs for your readers.

When writing your documentation, it helps to think about:

* Who are you writing for?
* What will they be trying to do when they read the documentation?
* What information are you providing? Is it a concept, a task, or reference?


## The templates

Current templates:

| Template name | Documentation type | Description |
| ------------- | ------------------ | ----------- |
| API Project overview | Concept | An overview of your API |
| API Quickstart | Concept, Task | Simplest possible method of implementing your API |
| API Reference | Reference | List of references related to your API |
| Tutorial | Concept, Task | A training document for a product or topic |
| Postman collections | Reference | Get your audience up to the speed with your API |
| Changelog | Concept, Task | Keep your audience informed about what's changing and what's coming |
| Authentication | Concept, task | Help your audience cross the most painful hurdle |
| FAQ | Task | Document the most common problems faced by your audience and their solutions |
