# How to write useful FAQs?

The best FAQ pages do a lot of the heavy lifting on your documentation project. Theyâ€™re one of the easiest ways to get new users up to the speed and save time answering repetitive questions.

FAQ pages are important because they save time for both users and teams. users don't have to go through the trouble of contacting a team member to get answers to simple questions. Teams don't have to waste time offering support for questions that are frequently asked and could be easily answered with a standardized response.

## Use Service Data to Identify Your Most Common Questions

Your FAQ page should address the most common questions users have about your products, APIs and services. The best way to identify those questions is to tap into your Jira/Issues and see which problems users are consistently reaching out to you with. 

You can easily discover the most popular questions that users have for your team. Some ticketing systems even offer tagging features that allow agents to label individual tickets which then automatically categorizes them in a stored database. That way, you can sort your tickets by topic, date, or popularity, when you're analyzing your team's data.
